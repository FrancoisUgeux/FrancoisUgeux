- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FrancoisUgeux

- ðŸŽ“ I hold a degree in Computer Science, a testament to my commitment to academic excellence. My focus now lies in the pragmatic application of this knowledge to software and game development.

- ðŸ’» You'll find me in the trenches of Unity (C#) and Unreal Engine (C++), where I turn theories into tangible code. I'm all about practicalityâ€”making things work and making them work well.

- ðŸ’¬ Open to collaborative opportunities, I bring a professional and results-driven approach to every project. Feel free to reach out via email to discuss potential engagements within your esteemed organization.[email me](mailto:francois-ugeux@hotmail.com)
